git clone https://github.com/Saviour-Dagadu/movie-search
2. cd into your-repo
3. Install dependencies:
npm install
4. Add your TMDb API key:
o Create a .env.local file in the root of your project.
o Add your API key: NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here.
5. Run the development server:
npm run dev
6. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.


First, run the development server:

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
